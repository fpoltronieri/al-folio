I am an Assistant Professor (RTD-A) at the Department of Engineering, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.

I received the Ph.D. degree in Engineering Science from the University of Ferrara, in 2021. 
I collaborate with national and international institutions such as the Florida IHMC, Pensacola, USA.
My research interests reside in the network and service management areas. There I am looking into 
Value-of-Information, Digital Twins, and Optimization techniques for Service Orchestration and management
across the Compute Continuum. Filippo received the Best Student paper award at
NOMS 2020 and the Best Paper award at CNSM 2023.
