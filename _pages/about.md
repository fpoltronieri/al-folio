I am an Assistant Professor (RTD-A) at the Department of Engineering, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy. 

My research interests focus on the study of Distributed Systems and I am currently working on several topics: IoT, service placement and resource management for Edge/Fog Computing, service optimization, and Cloud Computing.
